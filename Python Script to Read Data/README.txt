I have used Pandas Toolkit to create a DataFrame for our data. I have used Pandas because Data can be manipulated easily using it.
This Python Script will create a Pandas DataFrame from the pipe delimited data file. Here I have stored dummy data in "data.txt" file which is a pipe delimited data file.
